# 🚫 Call Conflict Prevention System

## Overview

The Dialer System now prevents multiple users from calling the same client simultaneously, ensuring organized and professional customer interactions.

## Features Implemented

### 🔒 **Conflict Detection**
- **Real-time Status Tracking**: System tracks which users are currently on calls
- **Client Availability Check**: Prevents calling clients already being contacted
- **User Status Validation**: Ensures users can only be on one call at a time

### 🎯 **Visual Indicators**
- **Red Border**: Client rows highlight in red when being called by another user
- **Disabled Button**: Call button becomes disabled with clear tooltip indicating who is calling
- **Pulsing Dot**: Animated indicator shows active call status
- **Status Tooltips**: Hover over disabled buttons to see who is calling the client

### 🔄 **Real-time Updates**
- **30-second Polling**: Call status refreshes automatically every 30 seconds
- **Immediate Updates**: Status changes when calls start/end
- **Multi-page Sync**: All users see consistent call status across the system

## How It Works

### Starting a Call
1. User clicks "Call" button on a client
2. System checks if:
   - User is already on another call
   - Another user is calling this client
3. If available: Call starts and user status updates
4. If blocked: Clear error message explains the conflict

### During a Call
- User shows as "On Call" with client details
- Client appears unavailable to other users
- Visual indicators prevent confusion

### Ending a Call
- User completes call log and saves
- System automatically clears call status
- Client becomes available for other users

## Database Schema

### Users Table Additions
```sql
is_on_call BOOLEAN DEFAULT false NOT NULL
current_call_client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id)
call_started_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
```

## API Endpoints

### User Status Management
- `GET /api/user-status` - Get all users and their call status
- `PUT /api/user-status` - Start/end call status with conflict detection

### Client Availability
- `GET /api/clients/[id]/availability` - Check if specific client is available

## Error Messages

- **User Already on Call**: "You are already on a call. Please end your current call first."
- **Client Being Called**: "This client is already being called by [User Name]. Please try again later."

## Benefits

✅ **No Double-Calling**: Prevents multiple users calling the same client  
✅ **Professional Image**: Avoids confusing customers with multiple calls  
✅ **Better Coordination**: Team can see who is calling whom  
✅ **Clear Feedback**: Users understand exactly why they can't call  
✅ **Automatic Cleanup**: No manual intervention needed for status management  

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Basic Conflict
1. User A starts calling Client X
2. User B tries to call Client X → Should be blocked
3. User A ends call
4. User B can now call Client X → Should work

### Test Scenario 2: Multiple Calls Same User  
1. User A starts calling Client X
2. User A tries to call Client Y → Should be blocked
3. User A must end first call before starting another

### Test Scenario 3: Visual Indicators
1. Open Clients page in two browsers (different users)
2. Start call in one browser
3. Other browser should show red highlight and disabled button
4. Tooltip should show who is calling

The system ensures smooth operations and prevents calling conflicts while maintaining a professional customer experience! 🎯📞
