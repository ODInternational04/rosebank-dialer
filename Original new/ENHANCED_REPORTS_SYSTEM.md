### 📊 **Detailed User Attribution Features**

#### Call Tracking
Every call is automatically tracked with:
```sql
user_id: UUID (References the user who made the call)
client_id: UUID (References the client who was called)  
created_at: TIMESTAMP (When the call was made)
call_status: ENUM (Outcome of the call)
call_duration: INTEGER (Length of call in seconds)
notes: TEXT (Call notes from the user)
```

#### Database Functions
Enhanced PostgreSQL functions provide:
- `get_user_call_statistics()` - Detailed user performance metrics
- `get_system_statistics()` - System-wide analytics
- Real-time aggregation of call data

## How User Attribution Works

### 1. **Call Initiation**
- User clicks "Call" button on any client
- System records user ID with call initiation
- User status is tracked during the call

### 2. **Call Completion**
- User fills out call log with notes and status
- System saves complete call record with user attribution
- Performance metrics are automatically updated

### 3. **Report Generation**
- Admin accesses Reports section
- System queries all calls with user relationships
- Data is aggregated and presented with full attribution
